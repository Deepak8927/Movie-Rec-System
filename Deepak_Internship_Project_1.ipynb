        "# **Problem Statement: Movie Recommendation System 🎬**\n",
        "\n",
        "With thousands of movies released across various genres, users often struggle to find a movie that suits their preferences. The goal of this project is to create a Movie Recommendation System that suggests movies based on a user's preferred genre and desired number of recommendations. The system should store a collection of movies categorized by genres and use basic Python data structures (lists and dictionaries) to provide recommendations. Additionally, users should be able to customize their recommendations, add new movies, and search for specific movies.\n",
        "\n",
        "📌 Problem Statement:\n",
        "Design a Python-based Movie Recommendation System that:\n",
        "\n",
        "* ✅ Allows users to select a movie genre (Action, Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi, Horror, etc.).\n",
        "* ✅ Lets users decide how many recommendations they want.\n",
        "* ✅ Provides random movie recommendations from the selected genre.\n",
        "* ✅ Enables users to add new movies to the stored movie list.\n",
        "* ✅ Stores and retrieves the movie collection using dictionaries.\n",
        "* ✅ Allows users to search for a movie by title.\n",
        "\n",
        "📌 Project Objectives:\n",
        "* 🔹 Genre-Based Movie Recommendations – Suggest movies based on user-selected genre.\n",
        "* 🔹 Customizable Number of Recommendations – Users can choose how many movie suggestions they receive.\n",
        "* 🔹 Randomized Suggestions – Ensure variety by picking random movies from the stored collection.\n",
        "* 🔹 Add New Movies – Users can expand the movie list by adding their own favorites.\n",
        "* 🔹 Dictionary-Based Storage – Store and update the movie collection in a Python dictionary.\n",
        "* 🔹 Search Functionality – Allow users to find a movie by title.\n",
        "\n",
        "📌 Example User Flow:\n",
        "* Step 1: User runs the program.\n",
        "* Step 2: System asks the user to select a genre (e.g., \"Comedy\").\n",
        "* Step 3: System asks how many movie recommendations they want (e.g., \"5\").\n",
        "* Step 4: System displays 5 random movies from the Comedy genre.\n",
        "* Step 5: User chooses to add a new movie (e.g., \"Superbad\" under Comedy).\n",
        "* Step 6: System updates the movie list and saves it.\n",
        "* Step 7: User searches for a movie by title to check if it exists in the stored collection.\n"
